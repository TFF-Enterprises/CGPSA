# CGPSA - A Spam Filter for CommuniGate Pro
# Copyright (C) 2002-2003 TFF Enterprises
# Written by Daniel M. Zimmerman
# All Rights Reserved

# This is an example of a configuration file for the filter. The various
# configuration options are explained, and their default values are
# provided. To change a configuration option, uncomment the corresponding
# line of the configuration file and modify it as you see fit.
#
# This file must be installed as "/var/CommuniGate/Settings/cgpsa.conf", 
# unless you have changed the definitions of $cgp_base, $config_directory, 
# or $config_pathname in the cgpsa filter itself. The filter will not run if 
# it cannot find its configuration file. More accurately, it will run, but 
# it just won't process any mail (and mail will just build up in the queue).

#
# Boolean options (such as "debug") understand "yes", "on", "true", "1" as
# "true" and the obvious alternatives as "false".

#
# Options You Will Almost Certainly Want To Change
# (if you're going to turn CLI usage off, you can ignore these)
#

# The CommuniGate Pro username to use for CLI access. This user must have
# at least the "Can Modify All Domains and Account Settings" access right,
# and it is highly recommended that the user have only the "PWD" service
# enabled (so as to minimize the possibility of security issues).
#
# cgp_username = username

# The password for the username specified in "cgp_username". This is plain
# text, but it's hidden inside /var/CommuniGate (just like all your users'
# email and account settings, which are also in plain text). If somebody
# gets access to your email server using this, you likely have larger
# problems to worry about. 
#
# cgp_password = password


#
# Options You Might Want To Change
#

# A simplified mode of operation for the filter. If this setting is "true", 
# the filter uses the default SpamAssassin preferences for all messages and 
# uses the ADDHEADER functionality of CommuniGate to add SpamAssassin 
# headers to the messages it processes. In "headers-only" mode, the 
# settings relating to user preferences and state are completely ignored 
# (only global preferences and state are used), and so are the settings 
# related to the CGP CLI and remote addresses (the CLI is not used, and 
# local and remote addresses are not distinguished). The default setting is 
# "false" - that is, the filter normally runs in "full-featured" mode.
#
# headers_only = false

# A flag that indicates whether or not the CommuniGate Pro CLI should be 
# used. If true, the CLI is used to determine whether recipient addresses 
# are local or remote, and to locate user preferences (if they're being 
# used). If false, the CLI is not used at all, and all settings that depend 
# on it (in particular, those having to do with user prefs and state files) 
# are ignored. The filter then scans messages to all recipients (not just 
# local ones), and uses default preferences and state. The only reason you 
# would ever want to disable CLI usage is if you are running in 
# full-featured mode because you want SpamAssassin to rewrite messages, but 
# you don't want the CLI overhead; if you're running in headers-only mode, 
# CLI usage is disabled automatically regardless of this configuration
# option. The default setting is to use the CLI. 
#
# use_cli = true

# The port to use for the CommuniGate Pro CLI. If you have changed the PWD
# port of your CommuniGate server, you must specify the new port number 
# here. If you haven't changed the PWD port of you CommuniGate server, the
# default setting will work.
#
# cgp_port = 106

# A header that will be added to emails, in addition to the standard
# SpamAssassin headers (if they're enabled), to prevent loops. If you choose 
# to run all email through the filter without performing any tests on its
# content (such as looking for an X-Spam-Status), the filter will still work
# properly because of this. The primary motivation for any change to this
# parameter is aesthetic.
#
# loop_prevention_header = X-TFF-CGPSA-Filter

# A flag that determines whether direct mailbox addressing is passed through
# the filter. If true, then any message with a direct mailbox address will
# retain the direct mailbox address after the filter has scanned it
# (regardless of the scan result)> If false, any direct mailbox address 
# will be converted to an account detail (account+detail) after passing
# through the filter. The default is to retain direct mailbox addressing.
#
# direct_mailbox_passthrough = true

# A flag that determines whether debugging output is turned on. If you're
# concerned about speed, it may be (minimally) advantageous to turn
# debugging output off.
#
# debug = on
 
# The debugging level of the filter. This determines how verbose its output
# is, which in turn determines (in concert with CommuniGate's log level) how
# large your CommuniGate logs will be. The valid range is 0-9, where 0 means
# to output as little as possible and 9 means to output as much as possible.
# Currently, only levels 8 and 9 really output anything.
#
# debug_level = 9

# The "default home directory". This is where the systemwide SpamAssassin 
# preferences (inside a ".spamassassin" directory), as well as the helper
# state files (such as razor's logs and config files) will be located. 
# Note that the filter actually uses the values of "$cgp_base" and
# "$config_directory" in creating the default value for this setting, so 
# if you change those, the value below will no longer accurately reflect
# the default.
#
# default_home_dir = "/var/CommuniGate/SpamAssassin"

# A flag that determines whether or not individual user preferences will be
# used if available. There's very little reason to turn this off, as users
# can only change (or create) their preferences if you allow them to by 
# installing the configuration CGI.
#
# use_user_prefs = yes

# A flag that determines whether or not individual user preferences are
# required in order to run SpamAssassin. This is an easy way to ensure that
# SpamAssassin is only run for those users that explicitly enable it; 
# SpamAssassin is not run for any user that doesn't have a SpamAssassin 
# prefs file in their account directory when this flag is true.
#
# require_user_prefs = yes

# A flag that determines whether individual user state files are maintained
# by SpamAssassin. This allows each user to have their own auto-whitelist 
# and Bayes files, and can therefore make SpamAssassin more effective; 
# however, it does mean that more disk space will be used for SpamAssassin
# state. This flag has no effect if the installed SpamAssassin version is
# earlier than 2.50, because the functionality to switch state directories
# did not exist before then.
#
# use_user_state = yes

# A flag that determines whether auto-whitelist files will be used. If 
# "use_user_state" is enabled, this will enable individual auto-whitelists;
# if not, it will enable a systemwide auto-whitelist. With versions of
# SpamAssassin earlier than 2.50, it always enables a systemwide 
# auto-whitelist - more specifically, root's auto-whitelist (or the 
# auto-whitelist of whatever user the server is running as, if you have
# dropped root), and with the default SpamAssassin configuration the
# auto-whitelist will be created in "~root/.spamassassin". With 2.50 or 
# later, the auto-whitelist will be created in the user's CommuniGate 
# account directory if "use_user_state" is enabled, and the default home
# directory if "use_user_state" is disabled. 
#
# use_auto_whitelist = yes

# A flag that determines whether spam tests that depend on the network
# (such as Razor scans and blacklist checks) will be performed. You might
# want to disable this if you find that your messages are taking too long to
# be processed, or if SpamAssassin uses too much bandwidth (or other 
# resources).
#
# do_network_tests = yes

# A flag that determines whether SpamAssassin will stop a message scan once
# it hits the spam threshold for that message. You usually won't want to 
# enable this, but it may improve efficiency for very high email traffic.
#
# stop_at_threshold = no


# 
# Options You Will Almost Certainly Not Want To Change
#

# The hostname to use for the CommuniGate Pro CLI. There's almost no 
# conceivable reason for you to to change this.
#
# cgp_hostname = localhost


# End of Configuration File
